# Back in the Lake (sorta)

I've been a little stir-crazy over the last month. I started the 2023 lake season in April after a week of crazy hot days. This year, it's been a solid 40-50F and raining for the last 6 months. Only recently it's started to get up in the 60s/70s where I've felt motivated to get outside and get down to business. I got out on the lake twice in the last few weeks to do some preseason paddleboarding.

I'm thinking we're probably ~2 weeks out from the lakes being warm enough to swim in.

## Training

My training has been interrupted the past few weeks with work travel and a friend's wedding. But in general, I've been trying to target 3 days a week (MWF) of 6-7k with rest days in between and supplement that with some different sports on the weekend (paddleboaring, spin class, long walks).

In lieu of open water, I've been getting a lot of my volume by doubling up on masters practices. My team is lucky enough to have two back-to-back hour-long practice slots, so I'll usually stick around for half of the second practice.

Friday 4/26 (wow I swim really well on Fridays I guess). This swim was with the Austin Swim Club while I was in town for a wedding. They had a couple fast guys that pushed my pace harder than I ordinarily would have. Not to mention a super nice outdoor pool.

    4x50 descend @1:00 (:30-:27)
