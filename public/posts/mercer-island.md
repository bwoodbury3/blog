Summer goal complete!

Today Ben and I completed a 12.7 mile lap around the great Mercer Island in Lake Washington, counterclockwise, starting and ending at Luther Burbank on the Northest end.

There was a bit of a hiccup early on as the $50 inflatable kayak we bought on Facebook Marketplace sprung a leak about 2 miles in and we had to beach it at some random park. Luckily, we had a paddleboard volunteer do the rest of the route as our support.

From there up until the 10 mile mark it was stress free and we felt great. We decided not to take buoys with us and our pace was significantly faster as a result (1:20/100y).

At the 10 mile mark a lot of Ben's friends, my wife, Ben's girlfriend, brother, and Sivan all hopped in and either swam or paddleboarded with us to the finish. This included swimming under I-90 all the way back to Luther Burbank park. Swimming under bridges is super fun, I highly recommend it.

The last 500 yards were brutal. My mind had completely given up with a mile to go and pushing it to the finish line took a lot of grit. We made it at an astonshingly slow 8:30 pace.

Overall, crushed it at a 1:23/100y pace in 5h 13min moving pace, about 6 hours if you count feeding and kayak snafus.

Thanks to all of those who supplied us food and provided encouragement!
