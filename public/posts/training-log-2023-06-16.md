# Weekly Training Log (2023-06-16)
This week was getting back into the groove of extra yardage after practice.

Of note: we moved our Mercer Island swim plans from July 23rd to June 25th. We're ready to go and don't want to wait any longer! The crew is being assembled. More on that another time.

## Saturday
Saturday was day 1 of trying to get my butt back in gear. The workout was

    4 rounds:
    4x50 @1:00 smooth (:31-:33)
    4x75 @1:15 descend from strong
     - 2:00 easy -

The focus was on the 4x75s and seeing how low you could go with only ~30 seconds of rest. By round, my splits on the watch were:
* 48.1/45.3/44.3/41.9
* 46.9/45.4/43.9/41.8
* 47.9/46.3/44.9/42.7
* 47.8/45.4/44.3/40.1

## Sunday
Day off, went for a hike!

## Monday
Sivan and I went out to Idylwood park on Lake Sammamish and did 2k out/2k back for 4k total. It was extremely foggy on the water -- you could barely see the next buoy 100 yards away. We just hugged it really close to the shore.

Since I wasn't feeling up to a 10k+ right before work, we opted to keep the distance lower and swim a little faster at 1:19 pace.

Unfortunately some bugs must've got me while I was changing because I had a few bites on my arm that lasted for half the week.

## Tuesday
Master's practice on Tuesday was all out sprinting, which I followed up with a long aerobic flush at the end. The master's workout looked like:

    4x
    4x25 all out @:30
    1:00 easy
    4x25 all out @:30
    3:00 easy

I did the first 4 rounds all freestyle holding about ~:50 pace (12.6-12.8), one or two IM at ~:54 pace, and then one or two backstroke at ~:51 pace.

I am an old person now with no lactic acid tolerance so naturally I started falling apart by round 3. I stayed focused on keeping a 15m underwater on every 25 though and it actually helped dull the pain a lot.

After practice extra credit:

    500/400/300/200/100 straight chillin
    light descend from 1:10 pace on the longer ones
    500 cool down.

## Wednesday
Interesting set, all long aerobic.

    4x125 :10 rest
    500 strong (5:24)

    2x4x100 :10 rest
    400 strong (with paddles, 4:12)

    3x4x75 :10 rest
    300 easy

    4x4x50 :10 rest
    200 strong (2:09)

A 200 strong where you only go a 2:09 is not a good day. Otherwise the rest was fun. Another 5k day.

## Thursday
Today was race day! Former Ohio State guy showed up at practice and I had a lot of fun racing with him next to me.

    4x50 all out @2:00
     - (24.6, 24.9, 24.9, 25.8)
    6x broken 50s
     - 15m start @:30
     - 10m turn @:30
     - 15m finish @:30
    4x50 all out @2:00 from the blocks
     - (:24.6 back, :25 back, :31 breast, :25 free)

With sets like these you have to throw down on each swim and force yourself mentally to hold on for those ones at the end.

## Friday
Today's set almost felt more like a best average, mile pace training thing. Longer swims trying to hold a fast pace.

    6x50 descend @:55 1-6
    300 fast (3:07)

    6x100 IM descend @1:40 1-3/4-6
    300 IM fast (3:28)

    6x150 descend @2:00 1-2/3-4/5-6
    300 fast (3:07)

I was on fire for those 150s alternating easy/fast. Splits were:
* 1:41/1:34
* 1:36/1:33
* 1:36/1:31

Good way to end the week. The next few days I plan to hit it hard with a lot of yards and taper down to 3k or less by Friday. Then, _it's Mercer Island time._
