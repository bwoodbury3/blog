# Weekly Training Log (2023-06-02)

## Monday
Memorial Day holiday! I had to drop off my wife’s sister at the airport at 5am and then hustle back home to change into swim gear. A group of us decided to skip the pool that morning and instead met at 730am for a dip in Lake Washington.

This was actually my first time in Lake Washington after living here for 6 months. Lake Washington is quite big and it runs about 5 degrees colder than Sammamish, so you have to wait a little longer in the season for it to get to a comfortable temperature.

We hopped in at Juanita Bay, which is just down the street from the high school pool where I train. The park itself is nice, the beach access is maybe only 10 feet wide though. Just drop your towels on the ground and hope for the best, I guess.

The other side of the bay is surprisingly shallow water (2-6feet-ish) with a lot of weed that occasionally runs against you. At one point ~50 yards offshore it gets so shallow that it’s actually hard to swim, so you have to intentionally move closer to the docks. I wouldn’t be surprised if the water level drops far enough in the summer to expose a little island. Definitely don’t buy a house on the east side of the bay if you want a boat!

The route took us about 2 miles south to Kirkland Downtown, or at least a pier next to it. We downed some energy gels at the turnaround point and chatted for a few before we started to get cold and then turned around.

All told, this was about a 7k swim which was an awesome way to start the week!

## Tuesday
I was feeling a little sore on Tuesday but Tuesday is the day I usually like to go longer. At masters practice we ended up doing:

    16x75 @1:10
    100 all out
    12x50 @1:00
    2x50 all out
    10x25 @:40
    3x25 all out

The sprints were fine for where I am now but nothing to get too excited about (:53 on the 100, :24-:25 on the 50s). It would be nice to get back to the point of being able to dip under :50 in practice, but the focus this season is on open water.

After the main practice I pushed 6x500 @6:00. It sounded like a good idea in my head but ended up just being very boring. Garbage yardage is still yardage. 6.3k.

## Wednesday
Were it up to me I would’ve taken Wednesday easy and settled for 3k or so. But the normal masters workout ended up being like 4.5k and my training partner Ben was excited, so we snuck in an extra 1k after practice. 6k.

This put me at 130k for the month of May which beat my post-college era best of 115k set last year.

## Thursday
Feeling pretty beat up at this point, I dropped down to 5k. Apparently this workout was so uninspiring that I didn’t even bother to write it down.

## Friday
Our masters coach emails us Thursday afternoon:

> Hi Team.
>
> I received some bad news for Friday. A child had an accident in Juanita pool Thursday afternoon so the pool will be closed for at least 25 hours.

Ben and I made the rare decision to do a weekday lake swim instead. We met up at Waverly Beach Park on Lake Washington. This is a nice place to get in just south of Juanita Bay that avoids all of the weeds and shallow water. We hop in and do a wakeup swim of about 3k total.

## Saturday
Going to split this one out into its own post.
