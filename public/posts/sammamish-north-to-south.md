# Sammamish North to South
Our last adventure on Lake Sammamish was 10k of circling around but always staying close enough to the park that we could stop whenever we wanted. The next challenge was to actually _go somewhere_.

It just so happens that if you measure the distance between Idylwood Park and Lake Sammamish State Park, it's only about 14k, a little more than our previous best.

## The Route

Idylwood is the northernmost starting point in the lake. Marymoor Park actually covers the whole top near the river, but there don't seem to be any great access points to the water. Or at least ones that let you park your car close to the water, have a picnic bench for staging, or a beach to jump off from.

The southern tip of the lake is marked by Lake Sammamish State Park, which has a huge beach with a ton of parking. That seemed like a good place to end.

## Logistics
A few things to get right when you're doing an exploration swim:
1. **Food:** We got a pack of ~24 gels to split between 3 people. We each also brought some solid food (2x Cliff Bars, in my case) to snack on.
2. **Hydration:** The swim was about 4 hours in the sun, so I brought two bottles of water. The first was a biker bottle that was easy to open and drink out of while treading. The second was a larger REI screw-top that I could use to backfill. We also mixed in some high-carb powder -- can't remember the brand.
3. **Hauling Supplies:** Usually we fit all of this into our dry bags (these inflatable buoys you drag with you) but this time we were fortunate to have a friend with a Kayak. Having a Kayaker is super awesome for a lot of reasons -- you can bring more food, have a place to put trash, someone can take pictures, someone with a phone for emergencies.
4. **One Way Trip:** We're not starting and stopping in the same location, so you've got to drop a car off at the end location and then drive to the start.
5. **Participants:** The usual suspects: my swim friends Ben and Aric, with Aric's girlfriend Sarah manning the Kayak.

## The Swim
Sammamish State Park opens its gates for cars at 6:30am, which drove our start time. Ben and I met at the park right at opening, left his car there, and then drove in my car up to Idylwood. Aric and Sarah went straight to Idylwood to set up the Kayak. We met around 6:55am. On the drive up I remember us thinking "Wow, it takes 20 minutes to drive here _by car_. This is going to be a long swim."

We arrived at Idylwood, loaded up the Kayak, and hauled it down to the lake. We probably started swimming by 7:10am.

Our general ritual was to stop every ~2k yards (30 minutes) and load up on gels/water. You definitely want to be eating before you get hungry, and when you're in the water you don't really notice yourself getting thirsty.

The first 2k was very leisurely at around 7:45/500y pace (my watch is set to record a lap every 500 yards. It'll buzz and make some weird chirp noise). After we had our first feed we immediately dropped to a 7:10 pace which we pretty much held all the way through.

Along the way there were a few spectators. One guy ran out to his dock to take a picture of us and sent it to Sarah. Another guy Ben shouted at from the lake and asked if he was cooking up any burgers, to which the answer was no.

All the way through the 10k mark I felt like I could do this for forever. Once my body knew there was only 3-4k left, I started to feel things tighten up. I primarily was feeling pain in my lats but also my neck (probably from looking up to sight so much).

When you round Greenwood Point you can see 2 beaches at the park. Unfortunately for us, we're parked at the second beach. There are also lots of boats in this area, so we have to hug the coast all the way to the end. This adds another ~500 yards to the swim (green line) at a point where we're all just barely hanging on.

We made it in the end, with some tanlines to prove it.
