# June 2024 Update

Open water season is back!

The past month has been a slow ramp-up to put some miles on. The season kickoff was a quick out-and-back 7k. Water was very chilly but warmed up after ~15 minutes or so.

The next week I saw that Saturday/Sunday was going to be rainy, so I took Friday off and went out on the lake to get a 10k in. This ended up being 2x5k out-and-back laps since the water was so choppy.

The weekend of June 22nd I set out with the goal of hitting 15k, but after ~30 minutes on the lake I was just not feeling it. I ended up getting 10k in still but fell well short of expectations.

## Los Angeles

I spent the next week down in Los Angeles for work and did some fun workouts at the local high school pool. My old lap swim friend was training for the [Trans Tahoe Relay](https://transtahoerelay.com/). If you're not familiar with this swim, it's a relay race across Lake Tahoe where everyone does a 30 minute rotation, followed by 10 minute rotations until you hit the finish line. I tried to write a workout with a 30 minute aerobic slog followed by a 10 minute sprint ([strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/11744502596)):

    (pace in parentheses)
    -
    30 minute slog:
    5x100 @1:25 (1:06)
    500 negative split (5:26)
    4x100 @1:20 (1:05)
    400 negative split (4:22)
    3x100 @1:15 (1:06)
    300 negative split (3:17)
    2x100 @1:10 (1:05)
    200 negative split (2:11)
    1x100 @1:05 (1:03)
    100 (1:05)
    -
    10 minute sprint - aim for 5, if you hit your goal pace on every one you get to skip the last one
    5x100 @1:45 (1:01/:59/:59/:56)

The other workout I had us do was much more boring ([strava](https://www.strava.com/activities/11759875899)).

    600 @7:30 (6:29)
    2x75 easy
    2x300 @3:45 (3:14/3:13)
    2x75 easy
    4x150 @2:00 (1:36)
    2x75
    6x100 @1:20 (1:03)

I came back from LA and did a short 2300y swim in the lake to end the week.

## Last But Not Least

The next weekend I found a friend who was willing to kayak and together we did the west side of Lake Sammamish (7.8 miles).

...and then we kayaked back, which I thought would be easy, but turned out to be horrible.

Overall I would say I'm maybe a week behind schedule but excited to keep ramping up through the season!
