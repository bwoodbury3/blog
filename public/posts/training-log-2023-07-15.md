# Weekly Training Log (2023-07-15)

This week I'm getting back into lifting after a 3 year hiatus. My focus is now shifting to just generally being fast again. It'd be really cool to get back under :50 seconds in a 100 backstroke.

**Weights**: Chest and back. I wrote it all down but it would bore you. In short, keeping it light since no matter what I do I'm going to be very sore tomorrow.

**Swim**: Lots of aerobic backstroke with a sprint at the end.

Just as I predicted, sore.

Practice this morning reminded me of old high school workouts -- several rounds of 5-10 minutes of aerobic and then something fast. Goal is to be tired and then try swimming fast.

    6x50 @1:00 descend
    25 fast (back: 12)
