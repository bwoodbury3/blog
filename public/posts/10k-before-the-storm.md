# The 10k Before the Storm
I woke up this morning to a notification from garmin telling me I was **Strained**.

> "Your training load is optimal, but your HRV [heart rate variance] status indicates accumulated fatigue. Be sure to give yourself enough time to recover."

That's interesting actually, because I was feeling a little burnt out at the beginning of the week: struggling to move during practice, not wanting to do extra yards afterwards. Maybe my mental state was a symptom of just being physically exhausted from 14ish consecutive days of exercise. Or maybe my mental state was affecting my physical condition. I also did have a crappy night sleep the last couple days, though I'm not sure on the cause/effect relationship there either.

In any case, I should probably listen to Garmin and take a day off. But if I do that, then I'll have nothing to post here!

I promise I'll take a day off tomorrow...

## Sammamish, We Meet Again
The plan for today was a 5k out and back for 10k total, measured off of whoever's watch showed the least yardage so that all of us could have the full 5 digits on Strava.

I wanted to go at 6am, Ben and Aric wanted to go at 7am. Sivan wanted to not go at all. So we compromised at 6:40 at the usual Idylwood park. It's a cloudy day but thankfully not foggy. There's that classic Washington mist where water is definitely falling but nothing's actually wet. No one wanted to kayak with us today so we packed up a few gel packs and some water into our buoy dry bag and set out.

The first 2k was total garbage. I think at one point Ben had us at a 1:37 pace (per 100y). I was drafting off of him, not kicking at all. We took our first feed at bighouse (bighouse is this guy's mansion on the top of a big hill; I'm pretty sure the house is like 100+ yards long because it takes over a minute to swim from one side to the other) and after that we got a big burst of energy.

The next 2k I would probably describe as warming up. Still lots of stopping and chit chat and disguising rest as 'enjoying nature'. Then another feed.

After that we put our heads down and started crushing the pace. Easily went from 7:00+ to 6:25s (per 500y) all the way to the halfway point. Then we turned around and kept up the same pace for about 3k.

With 2k to go I wanted to see if I could push myself even harder, but pretty immediately fell off the pace down to 6:30-6:40. When I turned around and looked back with 500 yards to go, we had distanced ourselves out pretty far. Ben was about 50 yards back, Aric was like 500+. But we all made it.

In total our moving time was 10.5k in 2 hours 24 minutes. This is about 20 minutes faster than our first 10k 3 weeks ago! 2 more time drops like that and we'll be in olympian territory.

## All of the Good Restaurants Are Busy
Traditionally after you do any group swim you're all supposed to go destroy like 3 stacks of pancakes. But we tried two different places that each had 30 minute+ waits. We ended up getting some pastries at a bakery and then destroying a bunch of food at our respective homes.

Today was Aric's last day in America before he takes his post-college Europe trip for 2 months. He's been a super fun training partner and we'll miss swimming with him!

## Next Week
After today I feel very confident about next week's Mercer Island trip. We swam a little less than half the distance today but pushed the pace pretty hard. I'm sure that with smarter pacing and the day-of motivation this will be no trouble at all.

Garmin wins, I'm taking a day off tomorrow.
