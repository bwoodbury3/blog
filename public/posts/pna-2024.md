# PNAs 2024 and Open Water Season

## PNAs
For the last few months I've been piling on stupid yardage to try and prep for this summer's open water season (it definitely has nothing to do with the Strava yardage competetion on my club). Last year's goal was swimming around [Mercer Island](https://brianjwoodbury.com/?post=Mercer%20Island). This year, I've got my sights set on Lake Washington.

All that to say, I've been just doing stupid yardage and have let the other fundamentals slip: sprinting, strokes other than freestyle, starts/turns, and lactic acid tolerance. But I signed up for PNA championships anyway (PNA=Pacific Northwest Aquatics -- it's basically Washington + Oregon) and tried to cram all the race-pace training in at the last second.

I ended up signing up for distance freestyle and breaststroke events. Namely, the 1000 free, 100 breast, 500 free, 100 free, and 200 breast. And honestly I was about as prepared as I expected.

**Results**

* 1000 free: 10:27.21
* 100 breast: 1:00.68
* 500 free: 4:59.91
* 100 free: :48.45
* 200 breast: 2:16.98
* Medley relay split: :27.35 (breast)
* Free relay split: :21.49

All in all, I'm quite happy with how the 500 free and 100 breast went. Under 5 minutes at this point in my life feels great. And the 100 breast was only about 3 seconds off my best. I would grade my performance this week at a B-.

## The Summer Ahead

Lofty goals for this summer:
* Mercer Island again. Loved that swim.
* The full Sammamish loop around the lake.
* Lake Washington top to bottom.
* One travel-swim (TBD).

See you back in the lake (when it gets warm enough)!
