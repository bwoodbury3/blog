# Weekly Training Log (2023-06-09)
This week was a recovery week. Feeling pretty exhausted from the Sammamish trip so I decided to take it easy and just do the normal Masters workouts.

## Monday
Rest day.

## Tuesday
Pace day.

    Two rounds:
    4x50 @1:00 strong/pace
    4x50 @:40 holding the same pace
      - 1:00 break -
    4x50 @1:15 descend to sprint

The goal of this short set was to use the first 4x50s to settle into a pace that you try to hold when the interval goes down.

First round free holding an abysmal :28 pace; second round backstroke felt a bit better at :29 pace. I could get the sprints down a bit faster (:27 on the last one) but still not anything exciting.

## Wednesday
Aerobic base.

    100 @1:15
    200 @2:30
    300 @3:45
    400 @5:00
      - rest -
    4x100 @1:10 Descend
    3x100 @1:20   |
    2x100 @1:30   |
    1:100 @1:40   V

The first round was aerobic base; 1:03-1:04 pace with a 4:15 on the end.

The second round was more fun, descending the rounds down to a :56 on the end.

At the very end we wrapped up with 10x25s descend backstroke down to a 12.3.

## Thursday
More aerobic. I don't remember the intervals and didn't write them down, but it was :20 rest on the intervals.

    2x200
    3x150
    4x100 push
      - rest -
    2x150
    3x100
    4x50 fast
      - rest -
    2x100
    3x50
    4x25 fast

Was feeling quite a bit sharper than Tuesday on the fast 50s/25s. Still not feeling like I was in the spring though. That's what I get for focusing on aerobic for the past 2 months!

## Friday
Don't know what to call the focus of this day

    4x
    Nx50 kick @1:00
    Nx100 back @1:40
    Nx150 free @2:00
    N=1, N=2, N=3, N=4 on each round

Took this a little easy and did a light descend on the rounds down to 1:05 on the back and 1:31 on the free.

## Next Week
No open water swim planned for the weekend (looking a bit rainy), but might get out to Sammamish again on Monday.
