# Checking in

I recently moved back to my home state of Washington after spending the last 8 years inadvertently touring the US (school, jobs, etc). In my first or second month here I'd joined the local master's program ([plug](https://www.usms.org/clubs/puget-sound-masters-493/wo-group-folder/lake-washington-masters-1575)) and met a few people who enjoyed open water. I ended up logging around 3k in Lake Sammamish with my soon-to-be friend Ben and was instantly hooked.

Unfortunately for me, it would be another 6 months before I scratched the itch again. October rolled around and the lake temperature was dropping. I spent the wintertime in pools training for short-course season, hoping to build back my college strength again. Short course season went well but I didn't start taking things seriously until May 2023 rolled around.

And that brings us to today. I've started putting up bigger numbers in the pool and taking training more seriously, so I figured I would stand up this site to supplement my Strava page. Hopefully these posts are enough to provide some insight into what I'm doing in the water for anyone who's interested in the sport.
